# Repository Cleanup

This document describes the cleanup performed on the repository structure to fix duplication issues.

## Background

The repository previously had a nested structure with code duplicated across multiple directories:
- `/officestonks/backend/` (older version)
- `/officestonks/backend/backend/` (newer version with chat and leaderboard functionality)

This structure was causing issues with Docker builds and Railway deployments.

## Changes Made

1. Consolidated the Go codebase by:
   - Moving all code from `/backend/backend/` to the root level
   - Using the most up-to-date version of each file
   - Removing the nested directory structure

2. Updated the Dockerfile to:
   - Use the simplified directory structure
   - Build the binary in the correct location
   - Create a streamlined container image

3. Added missing features:
   - Chat system functionality
   - Leaderboard system
   - User profiles

## Benefits

- Simplified directory structure
- Cleaner build process
- More maintainable codebase
- Improved deployment reliability

## Next Steps

Test the deployment to ensure all functionality works correctly with the new structure.
