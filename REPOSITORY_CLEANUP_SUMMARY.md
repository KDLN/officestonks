# Repository Cleanup Summary

## Completed Tasks

1. ✅ **Relocated Go Files to Standard Structure**
   - Moved code from nested `/backend/backend/` to standard Go layout
   - Created proper directory structure: `cmd/`, `internal/`, `pkg/`
   - Ensured all Go code is organized in the right packages

2. ✅ **Updated Configuration Files**
   - Placed `go.mod`, `go.sum`, and `schema.sql` at the repository root
   - Made sure import paths are correct in Go files

3. ✅ **Improved Startup Scripts**
   - Created proper `start.sh` entry point
   - Enhanced `start-server.sh` with better database initialization
   - Added detailed logging and error handling to scripts
   - Made all scripts executable

4. ✅ **Updated Dockerfile**
   - Modified to use the new directory structure
   - Added proper multi-stage build process
   - Corrected file path references
   - Added debugging information during build

5. ✅ **Enhanced Security**
   - Added rate limiting middleware
   - Implemented IP extraction with proxy header support
   - Created admin endpoint for monitoring rate limit statistics

6. ✅ **Added Documentation**
   - Created `REPOSITORY_CLEANUP.md` to explain the changes
   - Added comments to key scripts and configuration files

7. ✅ **Created Verification Tools**
   - Added `verify-deployment.sh` to check repository structure
   - Built and tested application functionality

## Pending Tasks

1. ⏳ **Remove Duplicate Code**
   - Verify that all necessary code has been migrated from `/backend/backend/`
   - Remove the duplicate directory once verified

2. ⏳ **Test Railway Deployment**
   - Push changes to repository
   - Deploy to Railway
   - Verify that the application builds and starts correctly

3. ⏳ **Update Other Documentation**
   - Update `README.md` with new repository structure
   - Update deployment documentation

## How to Verify the Changes

1. Run the verification script:
   ```bash
   ./verify-deployment.sh
   ```

2. Build the application:
   ```bash
   go build ./cmd/api/main.go
   ```

3. Test locally:
   ```bash
   ./main
   ```

4. Check for any runtime errors and fix if needed.

This restructuring follows Go best practices and should resolve the deployment issues experienced with Railway. The rate limiting middleware adds an additional security layer that was missing before.
