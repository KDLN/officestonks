# CORS Fix for OfficeStonks Frontend

This guide provides two approaches to solve the CORS issues with admin endpoints.

## Option 1: Frontend Workaround (Immediate Fix)

If you need an immediate solution without deploying a new service, modify the `admin.js` file with the workaround in `frontend-fix.js`:

1. Open the `admin.js` file in your frontend code
2. Copy the entire content from `frontend-fix.js` and paste it at the beginning of `admin.js`
3. Remove the existing implementations of the affected functions (they are replaced by the ones in the workaround)
4. Deploy the updated frontend

This workaround:
- Attempts normal fetch requests first
- Falls back to no-cors mode if CORS errors occur
- Provides mock responses for successful UI operation
- Logs detailed debugging information

## Option 2: Deploy Your Own CORS Proxy (Recommended)

For a complete solution that allows actual data to flow:

1. Create a new Railway project using this GitHub repository
2. Configure the deployment:
   - Build command: `cp allow-all-package-commonjs.json package.json && npm install`
   - Start command: `node allow-all-proxy-commonjs.js`
   - Environment variables:
     - `API_URL`: `https://web-production-1e26.up.railway.app`

3. Once deployed, update `admin.js` to use your new proxy URL:
   ```javascript
   // For Railway deployment, we might have different URLs for frontend and backend
   // Update this line to point to your new proxy service
   const ADMIN_URL = isLocalhost
     ? '/api/admin'
     : 'https://your-new-proxy-url.up.railway.app/admin';
   ```

4. Deploy the updated frontend

## Testing the Solution

To verify the solution is working:

1. Log in as an admin user
2. Open the browser developer tools (F12)
3. Go to the Console tab
4. Navigate to admin pages and check for CORS errors
5. Try admin actions such as resetting stock prices

If using Option 1, you should see logs indicating fallback to mock data.
If using Option 2, you should see successful API calls through your proxy.

## Need Additional Help?

If you continue to experience issues:

1. Try the `cors-verify.html` tool to test specific endpoints
2. Check the proxy logs for error messages
3. Verify the token is correctly passed in requests

For immediate frontend functionality, Option 1 provides a working UI without backend communication, while Option 2 establishes actual backend connectivity.
