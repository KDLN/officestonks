Insider Trading Events:

Risk and Reward: Players can engage in insider trading events with a chance of significant gain.

Penalties: If caught, they risk losing a large amount of money.

Stock Market Simulation
Market Influence: Stock prices change based on:

Player Activity: The volume of buying and selling affects prices.

Random Events: Fictional events impact specific sectors.

Random Events:

Sector Impact: Events that affect entire industries (e.g., tech boom, oil spill).

Frequency: Occur at random intervals to keep the game dynamic.

Winning Conditions
Portfolio Value: Players progress and compete based on the total value of their portfolios.

Leaderboards:

Daily, Weekly, Monthly Rankings: Display top players globally based on their portfolio performance.

Social Features
Mock AOL Chat Room: A chat system reminiscent of classic AOL chat rooms for player interaction.

News Ticker: In-game alerts and notifications displayed in a ticker format.

Technical Stack
Backend
Language: Golang

Framework: Standard library or Gorilla Mux for routing

Database: MySQL

Real-Time Communication: WebSockets for live updates

Hosting: Railway (scalable as user base grows)

Frontend
Option 1: React.js

Advantages: Component-based architecture, reusable UI components

Libraries: Use Socket.IO for WebSocket communication

Option 2: Vanilla JavaScript with HTML/CSS

Advantages: Lightweight, simpler for a classic look

Implementation: Use native WebSocket API for live updates

Design Theme: Windows 95/AOL classic web feel

Styling: Use CSS to mimic classic UI elements (buttons, icons, fonts)

Architecture Overview
Client-Server Model: The frontend sends requests to the backend API server.

WebSockets: Bi-directional communication for real-time stock updates and chat messages.

Database Layer:

User Data: Authentication credentials, portfolio details

Stock Data: Current prices, historical data, event impacts

Authentication:

Method: Username and password

Security: Basic encryption, input validation, hashing passwords

Concurrency Handling:

Goroutines: Utilize Golang's lightweight threads for handling multiple connections

Mutexes/Channels: Ensure data consistency when multiple users interact simultaneously

Development Roadmap
1. Planning and Design
Define Data Models:

Users: ID, username, hashed password, portfolio

Stocks: ID, company name, current price, sector

Events: Event ID, description, affected sector, impact value

Design API Endpoints:

Authentication: Login, registration

Stock Operations: Buy, sell, get stock prices

Leaderboard: Fetch rankings

Chat System: Send and receive messages

2. Backend Development
Set Up Project Structure:

Organize folders for handlers, models, services, and routes.

Implement Authentication:

Use secure password hashing (e.g., bcrypt).

Create middleware for session management.

Develop Stock Market Logic:

Price Calculation:

Base on supply and demand from player transactions.

Apply random event modifiers.

Random Events Generator:

Schedule events at random intervals.

Update affected stock prices accordingly.

WebSocket Integration:

Implement real-time updates for stock prices and chat.

Handle connections and broadcast messages efficiently.

Database Integration:

Set up MySQL database.

Write functions for CRUD operations on user and stock data.

3. Frontend Development
Design the UI:

Create a mockup reflecting the Windows 95/AOL theme.

Focus on simplicity and usability.

Implement Core Features:

Stock Dashboard: Display current stock prices and player portfolio.

Trading Interface: Forms to buy and sell stocks.

Leaderboards: Display rankings with real-time updates.

Chat Room: Implement the mock AOL chat room.

WebSocket Communication:

Establish connections to receive live updates.

Handle incoming data to update the UI dynamically.

4. Testing
Unit Testing:

Write tests for backend functions (e.g., stock price calculations, event impacts).

Integration Testing:

Test API endpoints with tools like Postman.

Ensure seamless communication between frontend and backend.

User Acceptance Testing:

Have a small group of users test the game.

Gather feedback on gameplay and user experience.

5. Deployment
Set Up on Railway:

Configure the server environment.

Set up continuous deployment pipelines if possible.

Database Hosting:

Ensure the MySQL database is securely accessible by the backend.

Scaling Considerations:

Monitor resource usage.

Plan for scaling up as the user base grows.

Additional Considerations
Security
Basic Measures:

Validate all user inputs to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.

Use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.

Password Security:

Store passwords securely using hashing algorithms.

Cheating Prevention:

Implement server-side checks for transactions.

Monitor for abnormal activities (e.g., rapid trading beyond normal limits).

Performance Optimization
Caching:

Use in-memory caching for frequently accessed data like stock prices.

Efficient Data Structures:

Optimize algorithms for calculating stock prices and handling events.

Load Testing:

Simulate multiple users to test server performance under load.

Future Enhancements
Mobile Optimization:

Improve responsiveness for better mobile support.

Advanced Features:

Add more complex financial instruments (e.g., options, futures).

Introduce achievements or badges for player engagement.

Social Media Integration:

Allow players to share achievements on platforms like Twitter or Facebook.

Conclusion
Building "Office Stonks" is an exciting project that combines real-time multiplayer interactions with a simulated stock market environment. By following this development plan, you'll create a solid foundation for your game, ensuring a fun and engaging experience for your players.
